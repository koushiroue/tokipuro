    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>

    <p> <div class="indented">
    "What a fucking day" "Travelled back to the past and found myself getting pranked by my younger self" "Not just that, I got slapped around this and there until I somehow got into this mess"
    </div>
    <br>Damon sighed at his situation while walking into the unknown space.
    <br>
    <div class="indented">
    <br>"Hell-" "Wait which bastard would say hello when he's going into some unknown place"
    </div>
    <br>Damon facepalmed while walking forward into the dark abyss of unknown. Then, he realizes someone or something was following him. He looked back and saw a creature that he could not comprehend at all. It's appearance would be like the sky became a monster and gave itself some ruby eyes. As Damon takes a few steps backwards, he realized he was already surrounded by the unknown creatures.
    <br>
    <div class="indented">
    <br>"Shit Altair was right I'm gonna get raped by these creatures"
    </div>
    <br>Trying to find a weapon, he finds himself the pocket watch inside his pocket which he used to go back in time.
    <div class="indented">
    <br>"Oh right I could just turn back time from the start. What a fucking idiot I am"
    </div>
    <br>Damon quickly swung the pocket watch backwards. He kept doing it with a smug until he realized it's not working.
    <br>
    <div class="indented">
    <br>"Oh no" "Please not like this" "Why are you not working this time"
    <br>"What if I use the pocket watch as weapon?" "Let's see here if it can deal any damage to these filthy beings"
    </div>
    <br>Damon thought of a plan out of nowhere despite knowing he is going to lose. He starts swinging the watch at a faster speed. Yet, it's futile as the watch just bounces off the creatures.
    <br>
    <div class="indented">
      <br>"Not even a hit huh?"
    </div>
    <br>The creatures around him are getting closer by the second.
    <div class="indented">
      <br>"What the fuck do I need to do to survive this shit!?" "Press some random buttons until something happens!?"
    </div>
     <br>He did it anyway. The watch glows brightly giving quite an aura.
     <br>
     <div class="indented">
       <br>"Nice. A fucking light mode. Very useful"
       </div>
       <br> He throws the watch away as he felt it was useless. Suddenly, when the glowing watch touched one of the creatures, it made a wound on it's legs.
       <br>
       <div class="indented">
         <br>"NOW YOU ARE BEING FUCKING USEFUL!" "SHIT I NEED TO GET THE WATCH BACK"
       </div>
       <br> Damon quickly dashes through the swarm and picks up the glowing watch. He swings it as hard as he could so it can be used as a weapon.
